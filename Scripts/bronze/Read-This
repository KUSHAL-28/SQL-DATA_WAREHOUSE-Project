Building the Bronze Layer

Steps:

1. Analysis:
   - Conduct interviews with source system experts to understand the source systems and their data.

2. Data Ingestion:
   - Develop methods to load data from source systems into the data warehouse, creating a bridge between source and target systems.

3. Data Validation:
   - Perform quality control to ensure data completeness by comparing the number of records between the source system and the data warehouse.
   - Conduct schema checks to verify that the data is placed correctly within the data warehouse.

4. Documentation and Version Control:
   - Document the processes and data model thoroughly.
   - Commit your work to version control systems like Git to keep track of changes and updates.
